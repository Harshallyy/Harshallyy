### About Me:  
<p > Hi, I am Harshal Gautam, economics graduate with a strong logical mindset, now transitioning into tech through data analysis, Python, and competitive programming. I simplify complex ideas — whether it’s teaching analytical reasoning or writing clean code to solve real-world problems. </p>

<p > Currently building data projects in Python (like Netflix content analysis), and actively solving DSA problems on platforms like Codeforces (1400+ rating, https://codeforces.com/profile/Harshallyy) and CodeChef (1400+ rating, https://codechef.com/users/harshallyy)). </p>

<p> I’ve also taught 200+ hours of logic puzzles and analytical reasoning to students — combining clarity, patience, and strategic thinking. </p>
<p> Competitive chess player with a 2000+ online rating on various platforms and a state-level ranking 46th in the Rajasthan Rapid Chess Championship. </p>
